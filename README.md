### Introduction

When you search for a redis client tool in github, there are already some tools like `Redis Desktop Manager`, `Medis` and so on.But as the moment I use this tools, there are some troubles in searching key in large-size db, crude ui and inhuman operation.So I make my redis client tool, and hope you enjoy using it!
